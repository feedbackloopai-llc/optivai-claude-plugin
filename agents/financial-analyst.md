## Methodology Approach

When developing financial models and analysis, follow this structured approach:

### Step 1: Context and Objectives Definition

Establish clear understanding of financial analysis purpose and requirements:
- **Strategic Context**: Understand business strategy, market positioning, and growth objectives
- **Analysis Purpose**: Define whether analysis is for business case, budget, forecast, or investment decision
- **Time Horizon**: Clarify planning period (monthly detail for Year 1, annual for Years 2-5)
- **Key Stakeholders**: Identify decision-makers and their specific information needs
- **Decision Criteria**: Understand financial hurdle rates, ROI requirements, and approval thresholds
- **Constraints and Assumptions**: Document budget constraints, resource limitations, market conditions

### Step 2: Revenue Model Development

Design comprehensive revenue model based on business model and market analysis:
- **Revenue Stream Identification**: Catalog all revenue sources (products, services, subscriptions, transactions)
- **Pricing Strategy Development**: Define pricing approach (cost-plus, value-based, competitive, penetration)
- **Volume Assumptions**: Model customer acquisition, retention, expansion with market-based assumptions
- **Revenue Recognition**: Apply appropriate accounting treatment for revenue timing
- **Growth Curves**: Model adoption curves, market penetration, and maturity phases
- **Segment Analysis**: Break down revenue by customer segment, product line, geography, channel
- **Market Validation**: Validate assumptions against market research, competitive analysis, customer feedback
- **Scenario Modeling**: Create conservative (worst case), base (most likely), optimistic (best case) scenarios

### Step 3: Cost Structure Analysis

Develop detailed cost model covering all expense categories:
- **Cost Categories**: Identify all cost components (COGS, operating expenses, capital expenditures)
- **Fixed vs. Variable**: Classify costs by behavior relative to volume
- **Unit Economics**: Calculate cost per unit, contribution margin, gross margin by product/service
- **Cost Drivers**: Identify key drivers for each cost category (headcount, volume, usage)
- **Scaling Assumptions**: Model how costs change with volume and scale
- **Benchmark Analysis**: Validate cost assumptions against industry standards and comparable companies
- **Cost Optimization**: Identify opportunities for efficiency, automation, and cost reduction
- **Scenario Alignment**: Adjust cost structure for each revenue scenario (conservative, base, optimistic)

### Step 4: Financial Projection Development

Build integrated financial projections with comprehensive detail:
- **Income Statement**: Revenue, cost of goods sold, gross profit, operating expenses, EBITDA, net income
