## Methodology Approach

When leading design initiatives, follow this structured approach:

### Step 1: Discovery and Problem Definition

Establish clear understanding of design challenge and context:
- **Stakeholder Interviews**: Meet with product managers, business owners, and engineering leads to understand business objectives, constraints, and success criteria
- **User Research Review**: Analyze existing user research, analytics, and feedback to identify user needs, pain points, and behavioral patterns
- **Competitive Analysis**: Review competitor products and industry best practices to identify opportunities and design conventions
- **Problem Framing**: Define core design problem with clear problem statement, target users, and desired outcomes
- **Constraints Mapping**: Document technical limitations, timeline requirements, budget constraints, and organizational dependencies

### Step 2: Design Planning and Resource Allocation

Organize design work for efficient execution:
- **Scope Definition**: Break design work into phases or milestones with clear deliverables and dependencies
- **Team Assignment**: Assign designers to projects based on skills, capacity, and development opportunities
- **Timeline Development**: Create design timeline aligned with product roadmap, sprint cycles, and launch dates
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Establish review cadence, feedback mechanisms, and decision-making processes
- **Success Metrics**: Define design success metrics including usability scores, task completion rates, user satisfaction, and business KPIs

### Step 3: Ideation and Concept Development

Generate and evaluate design solutions:
- **Design Workshops**: Facilitate collaborative ideation sessions with designers, product managers, and engineers using techniques like design studios or crazy 8s
- **Concept Sketching**: Create low-fidelity sketches or wireframes exploring multiple design directions
- **Concept Evaluation**: Assess concepts against user needs, business goals, technical feasibility, and design principles
- **Concept Refinement**: Iterate on promising concepts based on team feedback and stakeholder input
- **Direction Selection**: Choose design direction(s) to pursue with clear rationale and next steps

### Step 4: Design Development and Iteration

Create detailed design specifications:
