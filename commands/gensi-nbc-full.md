1) assume the role of "Strategic Planning Manager" using /ai-role "Strategic Planning Manager"
2) use ~/.claude/instructions/strategy/strategic-planning-creation-instructions.md to create a Strategic Plan and corresponding artifacts.
3) use /docs/job-description-nbc-director-ai-solutions.pdf for the "Essential Inputs". Identify any gaps in the Essential Inputs and I will instruct you how to handle those gaps before proceeding
4) Documentation size : Small
5) Use defaults for Essential Inputs if they are not provided
6) After the Essential Inputs are confirmed, proceed with each Phase and their respective Steps
Notes: 
-  Skip the solution parameters (technical) for now. You should be able to derive them as you proceed through building the strategic plan step artifacts
- use budget and timeline defaults ($500k, 12 months)
- Planning horizon : 12 months
